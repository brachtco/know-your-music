##Under the Hood

We used two APIs to fetch the information for arists: Last.fm and TasteDive.

The Last.FM API was utilized to fetch the artist name, bio, album image, genres and top 5 tracks.
The TasteDive API gives us the similar tracks.

For CSS, we used the the Materialize library, as well as style.css, and we used Google fonts.
For Javascript we utiilzed jQuery and Materialize libraries and our own script.js.
